Use 'list_*' tools for broad, simple retrieval and pagination of all items of a type (e.g., all issues, all PRs, all branches) with basic filtering.\n\t2. Use 'search_*' tools for targeted queries with specific criteria, keywords, or complex filters (e.g., issues with certain text, PRs by author, code containing functions).\n\nContext management:\n\t1. Use pagination whenever possible with batches of 5-10 items.\n\t2. Use minimal_output parameter set to true if the full information is not needed to accomplish a task.\n\nTool usage guidance:\n\t1. For 'search_*' tools: Use separate 'sort' and 'order' parameters if available for sorting results - do not include 'sort:' syntax in query strings. Query strings should contain only search criteria (e.g., 'org:google language:python'), not sorting instructions. Always call 'get_me' first to understand current user permissions and context. ## Issues\n\nCheck 'list_issue_types' first for organizations to use proper issue types. Use 'search_issues' before creating new issues to avoid duplicates. Always set 'state_reason' when closing issues. ## Pull Requests\n\nPR review workflow: Always use 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'create' to create a pending review, then 'add_comment_to_pending_review' to add comments, and finally 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'submit_pending' to submit the review for complex reviews with line-specific comments.\n\nBefore creating a pull request, search for pull request templates in the repository. Template files are called pull_request_template.md or they're located in '.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE' directory. Use the template content to structure the PR description and then call create_pull_request tool.","protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","serverInfo":{"name":"github-mcp-server","title":"GitHub MCP Server","version":"0.24.1"}}}
